# CSV-Reports-Generator

In this project, i've made an automatic reports ganerator in jupyter Notebook enviourment. 
The reports presents analyesd data from a single or multiple runs made by our company's product (Green IC Generator).

The user can load the data in form of CSV file.

* You can find an example report in this repo ("Report_Ganerated.html") - you'll have to download it to see it, github will only present the code.
